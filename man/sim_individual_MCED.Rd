\value{
A data frame with the individual's first-cancer outcomes (onset, screen/clinical diagnosis times and stages),
cancer death times with/without screening, and other-cause death.
}
\description{
This function simulates cancer outcomes for a single individual in two parallel scenarios:
with scheduled MCED screening and without screening. It generates cancer onset, screen detection, 
clinical diagnosis, cancer death, and other-cause death, retaining the first cancer by earliest onset.
}
\details{
Natural history models for each cancer site are specified based on a list of transition rate matrices for each site.  
The function tracks only the first cancer diagnosis based on pre-clinical onset. 
Cancer-specific mortality in the screen arm assumes a stage-shift benefit of screening. That is, individuals
who are diagnosed in early stage under screening but who would have been diagnosed in late stage clinically, are assume to remain in early stage post lead-time. 
For both screened and unscreened individuals, cancer mortality is projected from the point of clinical diagnosis (i.e., post lead-time) to prevent
lead-time bias.
